  | By now, your prompt must be extremely long and annoying to work with.         |
  |                                                                               |
  | The prompt is the text to left of where your cursor is in your terminal.      |
  |                                                                               |
  | The prompt is set from the PS1 variable.                                      |
  |                                                                               |
  | We can change it and customize it to our hearts content.                      |
  |                                                                               |
  | For now, lets make the current prompt tell the cursor to jump down a line     |
  |                                                                               |
  | so that you can type easier.                                                  |
  |                                                                               |
  | Enter this spell:                                                             |
  | [0;34m Â« export PS1=$PS1'\n' Â»      [0m                                                |
  |                                                                               |
  | Now you can type below your prompt                                            |
  |                                                                               |
  | We didn't want to change your current prompt info, so we just added a '\n' to |
  |                                                                               |
  | the end of it.                                                                |
  |                                                                               |
  | You can make this change permenant in the '~/.bashrc'                         |
