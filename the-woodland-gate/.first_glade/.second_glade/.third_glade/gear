# So far, you've learned how to assign values to variables      #
# and print them using echo. You've probably also noticed       #
# that assigning a new value to a variable overrides the        #
# previous one, which is the purpose of a variable. But         #
# what if you want to add a value to the existing value in      #
# a variable?For example, you might want to keep the wand       #
# sword and add the long wand  to your inventory as well.       #
# In that case, you can use the following syntax:               #
#    [0;34m export I=long_wand,$I    [0m                                 #
# With that, the long_wand  is added to your inventory. If you  #
# echo $I, youâ€™ll see that both items are now in your inventory.#
